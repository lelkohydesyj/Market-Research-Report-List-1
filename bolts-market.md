<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bolts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Half Screw Bolt</li><li>Full Screw Bolt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bolts are categorized into two main types based on their threading: half screw bolts and full screw bolts. Half screw bolts feature partial threading, which provides enhanced shear strength and is ideal for applications where the bolt is subjected to shear forces. In contrast, full screw bolts have complete threading, offering greater grip and clamping force, making them suitable for tension-heavy applications. The choice between these bolt types depends on the specific mechanical requirements and structural design of the assembly.</p></p>
